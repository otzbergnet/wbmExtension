Safari App Extension for Wayback Machine (web.archive.org)

# Why

The official Safari App Extension for the internet archive's Wayback Machine didn't fulfill our needs and we thus felt, we could create something, which would serve ourselves and the community best.

The original concept for this extension was created by gingerbeardman, who is also the driving force behind the business logic

# What does it do?

## Popover

1. the popover will show the last snapshot date for a page

3. option to see domain files and domain data
4. option to save snapshot of current page

## Context Menu

1. newest snapshot
2. oldest snapshot
3. page history

## Keyboard Shortcut

1. ctrl + w -> will open Page History

# Configurable

You are able to define, which context menu items are added to your Safari Context Menu and which keyboard shortcut to use. We elected to use strg / ctrl as it is a rather unusual modifier on macOS
